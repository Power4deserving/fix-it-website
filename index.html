        <h2>Our Mission & Vision</h2>
        <p>Fix It is not just about closing the skills gap—it’s about transforming lives. We connect individuals from underprivileged backgrounds who have trained in polytechnics with clients seeking skilled professionals. By providing opportunities for education and dignified work, we build a network of brotherhood and empowerment, ensuring no one is left behind in the economy.</p>

        <h2>How It Works</h2>
        <p>1. Skilled workers get vetted by partner polytechnics.</p>
        <p>2. Clients post jobs for services like plumbing, masonry, and more.</p>
        <p>3. Workers get matched with job opportunities and earn with dignity.</p>
